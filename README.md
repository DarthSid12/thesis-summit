# IITBHU MUN
IITBHU Model United Nations was initiated in 2012, the same year in which the institute was converted from IT to an IIT. In its initial two editions, the conference was held in association with IIMUN, Varanasi Chapter. The 2013 edition was conducted in conjunction with Kashiyatra, the annual cultural festival of the institute.
The last three editions have been completely independently organised events. The quality of debating, the standard of the agendas and the expertise of the Executive Board have been raising in standards year by year. A constant rise has been observed in the level of participation from all over the country that includes not only college but school students as well.
 Consistent efforts put in by the organisers have made IITBHU MUN one of the most sought-after event for MUNers across the country.
 So MUNers, mark the dates and be ready for some serious debating, exhausting sessions and a lot of intellectual enrichment.
